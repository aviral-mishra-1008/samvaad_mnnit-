# Samvaad MNNIT

Welcome to SamVaad MNNIT! This repository is designed for communication and collaboration within the MNNIT (Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology) community to develop a portal for the world to witness and understand the culture, life and vibe at the institute. Whether youâ€™re a student, faculty member, or anyone interested in engaging with the MNNIT community, this platform is for you. A number of institutes have portals where the media team works in collaboration with the student community to develop portals for expressions of thoughts, ideas, fests, events and day-to-day blogs. Particularly we were inspired by Monday Morning in NIT Rourkela to develop a site for similar purpose for MNNIT

This site, was part of the DevJam event in MNNIT, a developer event for first year students, the website was a learning project which was modified across the second year to reach the final shape which it has.
